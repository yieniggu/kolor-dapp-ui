# BECOMING PART OF THE KOLOR COMMUNITY
---

Kolor is creating a global access platform to democratize land conservation, by selling tokenized land to groups of people who are committed to conserve and look forward to receiving yields for future carbon credits sales.
This particular document explains the process that Kolor follows to allow third parties to conserve land in Patagonia, regardless of where they are. 

### The Process: How to conserve land in Patagonia with Kolor
1. Supply > 2. Presale > 3. LLC > 4. NFT > 5. Token > 6. Community > 7. Yields  

    - **Supply**: Kolor agrees with a private owner on a time frame of 4 months to purchase a specific piece of land. During that period, the land owner commits not to sell the land to others, as Kolor gathers the total purchase budget. 

    - **Presale**: Kolor gathers a group of people who are willing to collectively pay for the total land price, in order to conserve it. To make a reservation, people would need to pay a reservation fee and accept the reservation terms and conditions that are written below.

    - **LLC**: Kolor creates an LLC (in Chile, LLC's equivalent is an SpA) to hold the purchase budget and pay for the specific land to protect. When created, Kolor would be initially specified as the owner of the LLC.

    - **NFT**: Kolor mints an NFT over the LLC that owns the land.

    - **Token**: Kolor designates tokens to formal payers, minting one token per formalized reservation. Each token is equivalent to conserving 1.2 acres (equivalent to 0.5 hectares) of land in Patagonia.

    - **Community**: Kolor builds a community for token holders, which would be grouped in a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). As this DAO is initially committed to conserving the land for 30 years, members will have rights over potential carbon credit sales yields. 

    - **Yields**: Looking forward to the carbon credits market, Kolor is looking to certify the land under its protection. Thus, under the Kolor tokenomics and conservation DAO, all members have a right to vote on whether to distribute yields for carbon credits sales or invest them in more land conservation.

### Presale Terms & Conditions:
Kolor presale listing allows interested customers to reserve a spot in Kolor tokens sale, which will be sold at a price between USD $2,500 and USD $6,000, depending on the reservation moment and agreement. In order to reserve one token, customers need to pay a USD $100 fee.

Within the months prior to the token sale, Kolor will have reviewed the purchase promise documentation and the title registry study. With these on hand, everyone who made a reservation will be given the possibility to:

- Formalize its token purchase with the remaining amount of the agreed value at the time of the reservation.
Withdraw your USD $100 if you don't want to continue with the purchase.


- If by any matters Kolor fails to complete the land purchase, Kolor commits with everyone who made a reservation to return its USD $100 with an additional 20% fee (USD $120 in total) per token.

### The Kolor Role 
Kolor business model is based on land ownership for future carbon credits sales yields. To do this, for every collective purchase, Kolor will be claiming a 10% ownership over the total space, which means that all contributors will pay the whole land price, for the token ownership over a 90% of the total space. 

This 10% ownership fee is Kolor's business model towards the carbon credits market, which is charged due to the platform's yielding service, asset management and carbon certification.
